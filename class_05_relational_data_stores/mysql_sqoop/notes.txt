*** MYSQL
- Popular, free relational database
- Generaly monolithic in nature
- Can be used for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
- Existing data may exist in MySQL that you want to import to Hadoop.

*** Sqoop
- Sqoop is the union of SQL and Hadoop.
- It is made to handle large datasets.
- Used to import or export data from or into your hadoop cluster.
- Sqoop works on this way
  - create lots of mappers
  - populate hdfs
- It is not the most efficient way handling import and export on small datasets. 
- It is meant to be used on large datasets.
- Sqoop is a command line tool. 
  - Import data to flat file example: sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/movielens --driver com.mysql.jdbc.Driver --table movies [-m (how many mappers do you want to use)]
  - import data directly into hive example: sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/movielens --driver com.mysql.jdbc.Driver --table movies --hive-import
  - Incremental imports
    - --check-column and --last-value
  - Export data into mysql example: sqoop export --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/movielens -m 1 --driver com.mysql.jdbc.Driver --table exported_movies --export-dir /apps/hive/warehouse/movies --input-fields-terminated-by '\0001'
  - Target table must already exist into MySQL, with columns in expected order.
