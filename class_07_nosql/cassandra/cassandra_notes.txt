*** Cassandra
- There is no master node in cassandra (no single point of failure)
- Tunned and optimized for transactional queries at a large scale.
- Engineered for high availability, massive transaction rates, high scalability.
- Cassandra query language is CQL (Cassandra Query Language)
- Why Cassandra?
  - The CAP theorem says we can only choose 2 of 3 in a distributed storage: consistency, availability and partition-tolerance.
    - Partition-tolerance is a requirement within ˜big data˜, so is necessary to choose between consistency and availability.
  - Cassandra favors availability over consistency.
    - It is "eventualy consistent"
    - Cassandra can have a delay to commit your data to the entire cluster.
