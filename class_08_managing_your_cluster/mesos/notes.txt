MESOS
- Came out of Twitter
- It is a system that manages resources across your data center(s)
- Not only for big data. It can allocate resources for web servers, small scripts, etc.
- His purpose is to solve a larger problem:  It is really a general container management system.
- Mesos is not really part of Hadoop ecosystem. but it can play nice with it.
  - Spark and Storm may both run on Mesos instead of YARN
  - YARN may be integrated with Mesos using Myriad

Mesos x YARN
- YARN is a monolihic scheduler - You give it a job and YARN will figure it out where to run.
- Mesos is a two-tiered system
  - Mesos just makes offers of resources to your application
  - Your framework decides whether to accept or reject them
  - You also decide your own scheduling algorithm
- YARN is optimized for long, analytical jobs
- Mesos is built to handle that, as well as long-lived processes and short lived processes as well.

Where Mesos fits in
- If you are looking for an architecture you can code all of your organization cluster applications against - not just Hadoop stuff - Mesos can be really useful. (Kubernetes/docker may be useful too)
- If you are about Spark and Storm from Hadoop world, Mesos is an option.
  - But YARN is probably better, especially if your data is on HDFS
  - Spark on Mesos is limited to one executor per slave (node)
