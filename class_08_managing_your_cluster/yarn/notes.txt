Apache Yarn
- Yeat Another Resource Negotiator
- Separates the problem of managing resources on your cluster from MapReduce
- Enabled development of MapReduce alternatives (Spark, Tez) built on top of Yarn
- You can write code to it, but there is no really necessity for it.

- YARN manages the compute (processing) layer, while HDFS manages the storage layer.
- MapReduce, Spark and Tez are YARN applications.
