External query engines
- Hue
- Apache Phoenix
  - Sits on top of HBase
  - Allows you to SQL queries on things that are not really a relational database.
- Apache Zeppeli
- Apache Drill
  - Lets you issue SQL queries across a wide range of stuff that might be in your cluster
    - MongoDB
    - HDFS
    - S3
    - Google Cloud Storage
    - Microsoft Azure
    - Hive
    - HBase
- Presto
  - It is like Apache Drill
  - Lets you SQL queries across a variety of a different store technologies, but instead of being an Apache project, it is actually made by facebook and now it is open source.
  - Can talk to cassandra (Apache Drill cannot)
  - Can not talk to MongoDB (Apache Drill can)


  APACHE DRILL
  - A system that sits on top of your various technologies for storing data, and it basically lets you execute SQL queries on data that may not have a schema at all.
  - SQL engine that allows you to run relational looking SQL queries across a wide variety of non-relational databases and data files. 
  - It can sit on top of Hive, MongoDB and HBase, as well any flat JSON formatter, Parquet files that you may have on your HDFS cluster.
  - It is SQL (not SQL-Like)
  - Has a ODBC / JDBC driver so other tools can connect to it just like any relational database.
  - Although it works with SQL, it still non-relational under the hood.
  - Queries with lots of joins are not going to be efficient.
