Apache Storm
- Another framework for processing continuous streams of data on your cluster
- Can run on top of YARN
- Works on individual events, not micro-batchs (Like Spark Streaming)
- If you need sub-second latency, Apache Storm is for you
- Storm Terminology
  - A stream consist of Tuples that flow through...
  - Spouts that are sources of stream data (Kafka, Twitter, etc)
  - Bolts that process stream data as it is received
    - Transform, aggregate, write to databases/HDFS
  - A topology is a graph of spouts and bolts that process your stream
- Storm applications are usually written in java
  - although bolts may be directed through scripts in others languages.
