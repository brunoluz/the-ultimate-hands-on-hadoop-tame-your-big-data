FLINK
- Another streaming framework
- Flink is a German work for ninble.
- Similar to Storm
- Can run standalone, also on top of YARN or Mesos.
- Higly Scalable (1000's of nodes)
- Fault-Tolerant
  - Can survive failures while still guaranteeing exacly-once processing
  - Uses "States snapshots" to achieve this

Flink vs Spark vs Storm
- Flink is faster than Storm
- Flink offers "real streaming" like Storm (But if you are using Trident with Storm, you are using micro-batches)
- Flink offers a Higher-level API like Trident and Spark, but while doing real time streaming
- Flink has good Scala support, like Spark Streaming
- Flink has a ecosystem of its own, like Spark
- Flink can process data based on events times, now when data is received
  - Impressive windowing system
  - This plus real-time streaming and exacly-once semantics is important for financial applications
- But is the youngest of those technologies
