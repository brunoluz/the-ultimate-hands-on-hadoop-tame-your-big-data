IMPALA
- Cloudera's alternative to Hive
- Massively parallel SQL engine on Hadoop
- Impara is aways running, so you avoid the start-up costs when having a hive query
  - Made for BI-style queries
- Impala is often faster than Hive, but Hive offers more versatility
- Consider using Impala instead of Hive if you are using Cloudera

ACCUMULO
- Another Big Table clone (like HBase)
- Offers better security model
  - Cell based access control
- Offers server-side programming
- Consider it for your NoSQL needs if you have complex security requiriments
  - But make sure the systems that need to read this data can talk to it.

REDIS
- A distributed in-memory data store (like memcache)
- But it is more than a cache
- Good support for storing data structures
- Can persist data to disk
- Can be used for data store and not just cache
- Popular caching layer for web apps

INGITE
- An "in memory data fabric"
- Think of it as an alternative to REDIS
- But it is closer to a database
  - ACID Guarantees
  - SQL support
  - But it is all done in memory

ELASTICSEARCH
- A distributed document search and analytics engine
- Really popular
  - Wikipedia, The Guardian, StackOverflow and many more use ElasticSearch
- Can handle things like real-time searchs as you type
- When paired with Kibana, great for interactive exploration
- Amazon offers an ElasticSearch service

KINESIS (And the Amazon ecosystem)
- Amazon Kinesis is basically the AWS version of Kafka
- Amazon has a whole ecosystem of its own
  - Elastic MapReduce (EMR)
  - S3
  - ElasticSearch Service/CloudSearch
  - DynamoDB
  - Amazon RDS
  - ElastiCache
  - AI / Machine Learning services
- EMR in particular is an easy way to spin up a Hadoop Cluster on demand.

NIFI
- Apache NIFI
- Directed Graphs of Data Routing
  - Can connect to Kafka, HDFS, Hive
- Web UI for designing complex systems
- Often seen in the context of IoT sensors and managing their data
- Relevant in that it can be a streaming datasource you will see

FALCON
- A "Data governance engine" that sits on top of Oozie
- Included in Hortonworks
- Like NiFi, it allows construction of data processing graphs
- But it is really meant to organize the flow of your data within Hadoop

SLIDER
- Apache Slider
- Deployment tool for apps on a YARN cluster
- Allows monitoring of your apps
- Allow growing or shrinking your deployment as it is running
- Manages mixed configurations
- Start/stop applications on your cluster
- Incubating
