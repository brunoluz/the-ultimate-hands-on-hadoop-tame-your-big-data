What are your requirements? 
- There are millions of end-users, generating thousands of queries per second.
  - It MUST be fast - page latency is important.
  - So, we need some distributed NoSQL solution.
  - Access pattern is simple: "Give me current top N sellers in category X"
- Hourly updates probably good enought (consistency not hugely important)
- Must be Higly Available (customers does not like broken sites)
- So - We want partition-tolerance and availability more than consistency.
